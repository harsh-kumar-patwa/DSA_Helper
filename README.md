## Algorithm Used

**Topological Sorting**: This algorithm is used to find the optimal learning order of topics by:
1. Creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent topics
2. Edges represent dependencies (prerequisites)
3. Topological sort provides the order in which topics should be studied

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up Gemini API key (for chat feature):
   - Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Add it to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
     ```toml
     GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
     ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/main.py
   ```
