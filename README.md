# DSA Topic Recommendation System

A web application that helps users identify the optimal learning path for DSA topics using graph algorithms.

## Features

- **Topic Dependency Analysis**: Uses topological sorting to determine prerequisite topics
- **Learning Path Generation**: Suggests the best order to study topics
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy user interaction
- **Graph-based Backend**: Python implementation using graph algorithms

## Algorithm Used

**Topological Sorting**: This algorithm is used to find the optimal learning order of topics by:
1. Creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent topics
2. Edges represent dependencies (prerequisites)
3. Topological sort provides the order in which topics should be studied

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/main.py
   ```
